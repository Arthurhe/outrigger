v1.0.0 (...)
------------

This is the first major release of ``outrigger``!!!

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Parallelized event across chromosomes
- Added ``--low-memory`` flag for ``index``, ``validate``, and ``psi`` commands
  to use a smaller memory footprint when reading CSV files.
- Added ``--splice-types`` option to specify only one kind of splicing you'd
  like to find

- Un-parallelized novel exon finding

On a small dataset (394 junctions)
Before, detecting novel exons took 3 seconds on this small dataset:
