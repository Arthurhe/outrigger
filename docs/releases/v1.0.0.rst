v1.0.0 (April 3rd, 2017)
------------------------

This is the first major release of ``outrigger``!!!

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Parallelized event across chromosomes
- Added ``--low-memory`` flag for ``index``, ``validate``, and ``psi`` commands
  to use a smaller memory footprint when reading CSV files.
- Added ``--splice-types`` option to specify only one kind of splicing you'd
  like to find
- So the user can double-check the Psi calculation, create a ``summary.csv``
  file indicating the number of reads found at each junction, for all samples

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug that stalled on ``.bam`` files while counting the junctions
