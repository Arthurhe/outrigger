v0.2.7 (...)
------------


New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ``outrigger validate`` command to check for canonical splice sites
  by default: ``GT/AG`` (U1, major spliceosome) and ``AT/AC``
  (U12, minor spliceosome). Both of these are user-adjustable as they are only
   the standard for mammalian genomes.

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ``--resume`` and ``--force`` options to ``outrigger index`` to prevent
  the overwriting of interrupted indexing operations, or to force overwriting.
  By default, ``outrigger`` complains and cowardly exits.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Support ENSEMBL gtf files which specify chromsome names with a number, e.g.
``4`` instead of ``chr4``. Thank you to _lcscs12345 for pointing this out!

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added version info with ``outrigger --version``
- Sped up gffutils queries and event finding by running ``ANALYZE`` on SQLite
  databases.
